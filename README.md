# Progressive Web App

The point of this is to build a simple pwa that handles:
* a simple page load (1 html, 1 js, & 1 css file)
* a form submit (saved with IndexDB)
* a api call that affects the DOM

Essentially follows [Google's "Your First Progressive Web App" tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/#0)

For best results, needs [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)
